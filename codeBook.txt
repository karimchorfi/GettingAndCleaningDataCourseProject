This analysis get raw data of data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and compute the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The raw data for this analysis comes from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).
